## Michael Su
I am a recent graduate from Makers Academy (March 2022 Cohort) - where I grew from an aspiring developer who knew very little about coding in to a more competent developer, who now realises there is still much to learn about coding. I began my coding journey just before I enrolled onto the course - for years I have been working for my family business and decided that it was time for a new challenge. I began learning to code and quickly found myself enjoying it a lot - there was a lot of logical problem solving which not only brought great satisfaction when resolved, but also showed me that I would constantly be challenged and that it wouldn't ever get monotonous.\
\
During the Makers course, I developed a solid foundation in programming principles. I write code following TDD (writing tests first then using the simplest code to pass the tests to ensure my code is well-tested and written to a high quality) and I follow an effective debugging process (reading error messages, getting visibility on unintended behaviour in the code by using `console.log`). I was also able to practice agile working in our group projects and was able to gain experience leading the teams as we would rotate leadership with a different member leading every day.

## Experience
**Makers Academy**  
_Student_ (February 2022 â€“ June 2022)
- Used TDD and followed SOLID coding principles to ensure high quality code
- Received and gave constructive feedback during code reviews which meant that I was able to see other people's code and see alternative approaches that other people had to the same task, broadening my own knowledge
- Pair programmed with my peers on tasks, alternating between Navigator/Driver roles which was useful for knowledge sharing and for verbalising our code for the rubber duck effect
- Planned thoroughly by breaking down the specifications from the tasks into User Stories which were then given estimated timeframes and priorities depending on if they would be required for the MVP
- Followed agile methodologies during team projects with daily stand-ups and retros which helped with working flexibly as a team
- Used GitHub for version control, especially useful in team projects to collaborate with other team members and by using GitHub actions, we could reduce integration risk via using CI and CD

**Golden Castle (Cheshire) Ltd** (Family Business)\
_Financial Administrator_ (2016 to 2022) 
- Responsible for all financial aspects of the business including communicating with the accountants and suppliers so that everyone would be kept up to date
- Ability to show good initiative and take ownership of tasks, including stock management, which meant that it would be rare to run out of stock, keeping customers happy
- Maintain up to date sales and purchase ledgers so that they can be organised and submitted in a timely manner for our accountants

_Customer Assistant_ (2011-2016)
- Maintain good relationships with customers as evidenced by repeat customers on a regular basis
- Ability to work under time pressure to keep customers happy

## Skills
**Analytical Thinking**\
Having a background in Mathematics from studying it at University, I have been able to develop my analytical thinking. Throughout my degree, I was working daily to approach and solve problems using what I had learnt at my disposal. In my job, I am in charge of looking at our financials and keeping track of costs, so that when costs rise due to inflation or other factors, I can make appropriate suggestions to counteract, whether that's by increasing our own prices or otherwise.\
\
Throughout the Makers Academy course, I felt that my analytical skills were very helpful when it came to the problem-solving aspects of coding as it allowed me to think logically about the code and what it was doing. This was useful in a few ways - for example, when it came to debugging, I would have a good idea where the bug was occurring and would be able to then pin point it by getting visibility using `console.log`. It was also useful to understand code - during code reviews I was able to quickly grasp how the code I was reviewing worked and I would be able to deliver clear feedback as a result of this. It also meant that when given a existing code base to work with (which we were given for our [Acebook](https://github.com/jmcnally17/acebook-zark-muckerberg) project at Makers), I would have an idea on how the code worked very quickly so that I could build upon it.\
\

**Agile Working**\
In every group project I participated in in the Makers course, my group would always choose to practice agile working.\
\
We would do this by first planning our project using a Trello board, creating User Stories either from the specification (when given) or from scratch. We would have daily meetups every day, most days as often as three times a day for a quick catch-up. This meant that we had constant communication and would be constantly updated on the progress of each feature that was being worked on. During planning, we would assign each User Story an estimated timeframe - this allowed us to timebox our features and meant that if we got stuck too long on a single feature, we could use a different branch and discuss the blockers in our group meetings.\
\
By following agile methodologies, my teams were able to work flexibly and reduce the amount of time that was spent being stuck on a feature, allowing for better productivity and thanks to our constant communication, we would know how different parts of the code worked even without having worked on it ourselves.\
\

**Great Communicator**\
I have developed my communication skills by working with customers and suppliers on a daily basis.\
\
On the Makers course, the majority of the time coding was spent doing Pair Programming. When in the Navigator role, I would often articulate my thoughts on how the task would go, any potential bugs/blockers, and the proceeding steps. When in the Driver role, I would focus on completing the task at hand and try to talk through what I was doing.\
\
This would keep my pair up to date on my thoughts and my approach, allowing us to work more effectively. It also helped to increase my own understanding of my code and meant that by discussing and explaining our code, when we ran into bugs, it would make it easier to find where the bugs were, as when explaining how each line of the code should work, it would make it more apparent where unintended behaviour was occurring. 

**Fast Learner**\
For our final project as part of the Makers Academy course, collectively as a group we wanted to challenge ourselves and learn and apply a new technology - in this case React.\
\
I had no prior knowledge on how to use React but I managed to learn it in time (as did my team) which allowed us to meet all of our deadlines whether it was for our MVP or for our final presentation. I was able to do this thanks to the many materials that can be found online, and in particular, the course on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101).\
\
As a result of this, we were able to create the product that we had envisioned and delivered on the features that we had planned.\
\

**Working under pressure**\
When I was still studying, I was also working and due to this, I have developed the necessary organisational and time management skills which were required of me.\
\
As a result of this, despite being in a intensive university course studying Mathematics, I was still able to achieve a First-Class Honours degree whilst working part-time at my family business, which generally took away most of my evenings/weekends.\
