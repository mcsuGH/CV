## Skills

#### Analytical Thinking

Having a background in Mathematics from studying it at University, I have been able to develop my analytical thinking. Throughout my degree, I was working daily to approach and solve problems using what I had learnt at my disposal. In my job, I am in charge of looking at our financials and keeping track of costs, so that when costs rise due to inflation or other factors, I can make appropriate suggestions to counteract, whether that's by increasing our own prices or otherwise.

#### Working under pressure

When I was still studying, I was also working and due to this, I have developed the necessary organisational and time management skills which were required of me. As a result of this, despite being in a intensive university course studying Mathematics, I was still able to achieve a First-Class Honours degree.
