## Michael Su
Recent graduate from Makers Academy (March 2022 Cohort) - where I grew from an aspiring developer who knew very little about coding in to a more competent developer, who now realises there is still much to learn about coding. Thanks to the Makers course, I have developed a solid foundation in programming principles such as TDD as well as my processes such as when it comes to debugging. During the Makers course, I was also able to practice agile working in our group projects and was able to gain experience leading the teams as we would rotate leadership with a different member leading every day as well as in presenting, when presenting our projects.

## Skills
**Fast Learner**\
For our final project as part of the Makers Academy course, collectively as a group we wanted to challenge ourselves and learn and apply a new technology - in this case React. None of my group had much prior knowledge on how to use React but individually we all managed to learn it in time and still meet all of our deadlines such as for having our MVP ready. I was able to do this thanks to the many materials that can be found online, and in particular, the course on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101). As a result of this, we were able to create the product that we had envisioned.

**Analytical Thinking**\
Having a background in Mathematics from studying it at University, I have been able to develop my analytical thinking. Throughout my degree, I was working daily to approach and solve problems using what I had learnt at my disposal. In my job, I am in charge of looking at our financials and keeping track of costs, so that when costs rise due to inflation or other factors, I can make appropriate suggestions to counteract, whether that's by increasing our own prices or otherwise.\
\
Throughout the Makers Academy course, I felt that my analytical skills were very helpful when it came to the problem-solving aspects of coding and also when it came to debugging - being able to think about the code logically to track where the issue may or may not be if the code is not working as anticipated.\
\
**Agile Working**\
In every group project I participated in in the Makers course, my group would always choose to practice agile working. We would do this by having daily meetups every day, most days as often as three times a day for a quick catch-up and to go through any blockers. We would also use a Trello board to track our process and because of this, aswell as our constant communication, we would be constantly updated on the progress of each feature that was being worked on. By making new branches, we would be able to work flexibly so if we got stuck for too long on a feature, we could start on the next feature and discuss how to work on the previous one as a group.

**Working under pressure**\
When I was still studying, I was also working and due to this, I have developed the necessary organisational and time management skills which were required of me. As a result of this, despite being in a intensive university course studying Mathematics, I was still able to achieve a First-Class Honours degree.
